# üß© MVC vs MVVM in Swift and SwiftUI

This guide explains the **difference between MVC and MVVM** architecture patterns in **UIKit (Storyboard)** and **SwiftUI**, with clean examples and visuals.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ MVC with Storyboard

### üß† Model
```swift
struct User {
    let name: String
}
```

### **Controller (ViewController)**
```swift
import UIKit

class UserViewController: UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet weak var nameLabel: UILabel!  // connected from storyboard
    
    var user: User?
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        user = User(name: "John")
        nameLabel.text = user?.name   // Controller updates View
    }
}
```

üëâ In **MVC**, the `ViewController` holds both **UI code** and **logic**, which makes it become *fat* when the app grows.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ MVVM with Storyboard

### üß† Model
```swift
struct User {
    let name: String
}
```

### üí° ViewModel
```swift
class UserViewModel {
    private let user: User
    
    init(user: User) {
        self.user = user
    }
    
    var displayName: String {
        return "Hello, \(user.name)"
    }
}
```

### üé® View (ViewController)
```swift
import UIKit

class UserViewController: UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet weak var nameLabel: UILabel!   // connected from storyboard
    
    var viewModel: UserViewModel!
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        viewModel = UserViewModel(user: User(name: "John"))
        nameLabel.text = viewModel.displayName   // View just binds to ViewModel
    }
}
```

üëâ In **MVVM**, the **ViewController** simply binds to a **ViewModel**, keeping UI logic separate from business logic.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ SwiftUI Examples

### üîπ MVC-like in SwiftUI
*(SwiftUI doesn‚Äôt truly use MVC, but if all logic is inside the `View`, it behaves like MVC.)*

```swift
// Model
struct User {
    let name: String
}

// View (acts as View + Controller)
struct UserView: View {
    let user = User(name: "John")  // Model directly inside View

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Welcome")
            Text(user.name)   // Directly using model
        }
    }
}
```

üëâ Here, `UserView` is both **View + Controller**.  
Good for small UIs but messy as logic grows.

---

### üîπ MVVM in SwiftUI
*(Uses `ObservableObject` and property wrappers like `@StateObject` or `@ObservedObject`.)*

```swift
// Model
struct User {
    let name: String
}

// ViewModel
class UserViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var user: User
    
    init(user: User) {
        self.user = user
    }
    
    var displayName: String {
        "Hello, \(user.name)"
    }
}

// View
struct UserView: View {
    @StateObject var viewModel = UserViewModel(user: User(name: "John"))
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Welcome")
            Text(viewModel.displayName)  // View observes ViewModel
        }
    }
}
```

üëâ In **MVVM**:
- **View** only shows UI  
- **ViewModel** handles logic ‚Äî API calls, validation, state management  
- Easier to test the **ViewModel** separately without UI

## ‚öñÔ∏è Difference Between MVC and MVVM

| Feature | MVC | MVVM |
|----------|-----|------|
| **Model Creation** | In Controller | In ViewModel |
| **Logic Location** | Controller (UI + Logic mixed) | ViewModel (clean separation) |
| **Testing** | Hard to test (UI-dependent) | Easy (ViewModel testable separately) |
| **Best For** | Simple Apps / UIKit | Large Apps / SwiftUI |
| **SwiftUI Usage** | ‚ùå Not Recommended | ‚úÖ Recommended |

---

## üß† Explanation

- In **MVC**, the model object is created in the **controller**.  
  Swift (UIKit) uses this approach ‚Äî but it‚Äôs **not recommended in SwiftUI**.  
  The controller becomes heavy and difficult to maintain.

- In **MVVM**, the model object is created inside the **ViewModel**.  
  The **View** uses a **ViewModel instance**.  
  The ViewModel contains **all business logic**, keeping UI code clean and testable.

- In **SwiftUI**:
  - The **ViewModel** extends `ObservableObject`
  - The **View** uses `@StateObject` to access the ViewModel
  - The View only shows UI, while logic (like API calls or validation) stays in ViewModel

---

## üß≠ Architecture Overview

### MVC
```
Model  <---->  Controller  <---->  View
```
üß© The Controller acts as the ‚Äúglue‚Äù ‚Üí often becomes too big and hard to maintain.

---

### MVVM
```
Model  <---->  ViewModel  <---->  View
              (binding/observe)
```
üß© The View simply observes the ViewModel ‚Üí cleaner and scalable.

## üí° Quick Memory Hook

> üü¢ **MVC = Simple but Messy (fat controllers)**  
> üü£ **MVVM = Clean but Complex (needs bindings)**

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

> In **Storyboard (UIKit)** ‚Äî MVC makes the `ViewController` heavy because it updates UI directly from the model.  
> In **MVVM**, the ViewController binds to the ViewModel, keeping it light and **testable**.

## üß™ Unit Testing Comparison

| Architecture | Unit Testing | Reason |
|---------------|--------------|--------|
| **MVC** | ‚ùå Difficult | Logic mixed with UI (IBOutlet, View) |
| **MVVM** | ‚úÖ Easy | Logic in ViewModel without UI dependencies |

üß† In MVVM, create a **test case file** for your ViewModel and test its logic independently.
